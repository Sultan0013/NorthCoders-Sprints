HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create web
 pages. Itâ€™s a combination of Hypertext, which defines the link between web pages, and
  Markup language, which is used to define the text document within tags to structure 
  web pages. This language is used to annotate text so that machines can understand 
  and manipulate it accordingly. HTML is human-readable and uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text. This guide will help you understand the workings of HTML and explain it with examples.
